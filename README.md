# ParkingCarSpaceDetection
This is a part of smart parking car project.

Faster R-CNN model is deployed to detect car in the parking, the output is boxes surrounded cars. From that boxes and spots' coordinates, the program calculates and predicts if the parking spots are empty or occupied.

The precision of the program depends on the deep learning's robustness. So we can improve the precision by training the model with particular datasets.

The program has reference from :
